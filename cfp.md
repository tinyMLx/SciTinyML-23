## Call for Show and Tell Talks

We are soliciting **talk abstracts** for our Show and Tell day on Thursday April 20th, 2023.

We want to hear about all of your exciting TinyML projects! These can include classroom projects, research projects, in-progress projects, failed projects -- basically any kind of TinyML project!We are particularly interested in work that discuss:
+ Scientific Applications of TinyML
+ Applications of TinyML for the Global South and for Global Sustainability
+ Aggregated “best practice” suggestions for getting up to speed on new TinyML projects
+ Surprising discoveries gleaned from deploying TinyML into the real world
+ Work from early career students and professionals

**Note: re-submissions of previous Show and Tell Seminar talks are highly encouraged in order to share the work with a wider audience!**

### A Hybrid Talk Format

All talks will be pre-recoreded and submitted *before the start of the conference*. These videos will be played live during SciTinyML and followed by live Q&A.

### Prizes and Report

We will give our prize(s) to the top talks and announce the winners on the last day of the workshop. We will also compile a report following the workshop summarizing the content of the talks and talk authors will be invited to participate as authors on the report.
